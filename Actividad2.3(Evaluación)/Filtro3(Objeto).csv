After living in Amsterdam for 22 years and having become a consultant Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, my wife Patty and I, together with our 3 young children, moved to a place closer to the sea and nature. As a base, we can still be found regularly in our cozy beach apartment in Noordwijk aan Zee. This apartment is located on the 3rd floor of a 5-floor building and has completely been renovated in 2019.

Because the balcony is quite large, with a sea view, and is conveniently located on the sun (south/west), you can enjoy everything that happens on the beach and in the sea all day long.

Due to the large parking lot at the rear of the apartment complex, you will have no problems finding a parking space and you will eventually only have to cross the boulevard to walk to the beach. There are several beach clubs situated that provide sunbed rental and nice food /drinks, so that you will be completely pampered.

The center of Noordwijk aan Zee with its many shops and restaurants is also about a 10-minute walk from the apartment.

Our main goal is to let you feel comfortable in our apartment and hope you have a wonderfull stay in Noordwijk aan Zee!

With kind regards,

Erik and Patty Salentijn-Roosen

This area has been very up and coming over the last 10 years and we are really lucky to have so many excellent restaurants close by, whether it be Italian, Korean, Peruvian, or Mexican etc. The famous restaurant 'de Kas' where  they grow their own veggies is just across the road in Frankendael park. <br />The great thing about this area of Amsterdam is that it is a very peaceful neighbourhood, has wide streets full of trees, lots of water and several parks and yet there all the amenities you could wish for when it comes to shops or sports facilities. There is  even an open air swimming pool just 2km's away through the Flevopark. <br />We have lived here for over 20 years and still love this area of Amsterdam so much.",https://a0.muscache.com/pictures/miso/Hosting-919596555871471877/original/3c060bcc-ecd7-4891-9e79-0e091df19806.jpeg,21694318,https://www.airbnb.com/users/show/21694318,Stephanie,2014-09-23,"Amsterdam, Netherlands",I have British & Dutch nationality and have lived in Amsterdam for more than 20 years with my Dutch partner.

But to be honest, mostly out of a suitcase. :)

I moved to New York 12 years ago to persue a carreer in the modeling industry which causes me to be on a plane most of the time. 
But definitely not minding it as I suffer from a severe case of Wanderlust

I still visit Amsterdam often as all of my family is there and I love them dearly. 
However.. Whenever I'm not around I gladly open my home up to travelers. 
Same goes for New York actually :)

I love to cook, good food, wine, COFFEE
And everything that involves film, art, nature, fashion and history.

My favorite book is Shantaram.
My favorite movie; too many to name
I religiously go to the cinema every sunday.
(not to mention all the inflight movies)

Music; I could not live in a world without music.
And I enjoy opera and ballet very much. 
Unfortunately I do not go too often. 

As a guest I am very thoughtful, punctual and respectful.
I'd like to say as a host I am the same. 

My life motto is Amor Vincit Omnia
Love conquers all

Then you can have such a beautiful experience. Because we like to meet other people and be of good service, this is a nice combination. 
We have a special interest in Spanish-language, same as the Spanish spoken countries, that for I (Cindy) worked as a volunteer and travelled for half a year in Latin-America.
