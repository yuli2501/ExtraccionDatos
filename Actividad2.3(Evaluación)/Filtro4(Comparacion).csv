PHILOSOPHY

A dutch saying: ""Wie goed doet, goed ontmoet""

Translated: What goes around, comes around (but only in a positive way)

Interests

Peter: I love to do scuba diving and have a pint afterwards. If there's no diving spots around....just a pint. I'm attracted to most watersports actually. Sailing, surfing and swimming are fun too. Besides that I play field hockey and chess. I' ve been travelling to pretty much everywhere in the world and love to meet new cultures.

Marieke: also loves hobbies ;)

Music, Movies, and Books

I enjoy all kind of movies. Personal best would probably be Godfather 2.

I love electronic dance music like techno and deephouse and dance festivals, but anything with a beat or strong guitars will do.

I think I particularly enjoy world literature.

One Amazing Thing I’ve Done

Too much to mention: 
New York marathon. Diving trips all over the world. The culture shock in India.

Staying with Honduras' most popular pop artist.

Being invited to a family reunion with total strangers in Portugal.

We love travelling

We are Bas and Mirte, around 35 yrs old and we live in Amsterdam with our two little kids ages 2 and 4.
Our motto for life is work hard, play hard: Mirte is a marketing manager in FMCG and Bas is owner of a paragliding school. Enough about work; we both love to travel, far away or closeby. Bas loves paragliding and visits the beach and dunes at least once a week to fly; even more he loves paragliding in the Alps, so if he's not enjoying Amsterdam; chances are you'll find him in Austria or Italy. I myself love cooking, running (great combination ;-)), shopping and reading. And I hate how boring my life looks compared to Bas' ;-). 
Oh and we do have other things in common, we both love watching movies and series! 

We bought our house in March '15. With an extensive renovation (in both time and euro's) we turned it into our perfect little Amsterdam-palace  and we treat it with care.

The polder is part of a peat meadow area that was part of the Hollands-Utrecht peat area.<br /><br />The pastureland thus created remained intact for centuries.

My husband - Frans - and I have been living in Amsterdam for over 10 years. For us it's the most wonderful city to live in!

I'm Belgian and Frans is a Dutchman. Together we've done quite some traveling. We met in Mallorca, lived together in Ghent, Belgium for 3 years, lived in Istanbul, Turkey for 1/2 year, extensively travelled through Italy & Spain and in 2013 we came back from a 1 year trip around South-America. Though having seen all these beautiful places, Amsterdam has stolen our hearts and we can't imagine living anywhere else but here. Cycling through the city, across the bridges and next to the canals always puts a very large smile on our faces!

We love AIrbnb. It is a great concept. We are proud te be a member of this community and love to explore the world at other Airbnb nice places. We introduce ourselves.
We arrived in Amsterdam in 1992 ( Michiel) and 1994 (Marlous) for doing our study and since then we didn’t leave this amazing city (except all the travels and work experiences abroad) so we discovered the city at early age ( with experiencing all the good and bad things), started our career over here and now we have our family life in this lovely neighborhood which feels like a modern upgraded ghetto in the middle of the energetic city of Amsterdam.

We enjoy our family life with the kids who goes to school and has there friends nearby and playgrounds are all over around (our garden, “Vondelpark”, “Museumplein”) and within a second we leave the house for a movie (at Cinecenter Cinema near ""Leidseplein"" is our favorite) or a theatre (Stadsschouwburg at ""Leidseplein"" which also has lots of International Plays) or having drinks with friends in one of the bars or restaurant nearby (the “Pijp” or the Jordaan”). All within a short distance or a 10 or 20 minute walk. 

We love to work hard as an Photographer and an Advocate and doing sports like racecycling, jogging, yoga and we all play tennis. We do love art and painting. We loved to travel around the world and now with our kids we downsized the distance to overcome and explore Europe with his nice countries like Italia (our favorite till so far is the lovely place Lucca) and Austria (for skieing and staying in a nice family village like Zell am See), Turkey (with the charming surfing hotspot of Alacati) and our favorite cities like Paris ( we love to eat a croissant with our kids in Parque Luxembourg) and Tarifa (for hanging around in this kite-surfing place paradise). We also enjoy simply going to the nearby beaches of Bloemendaal (Beachclub Republiek), Zandvoort ( Family Beach Vooges) or Noordwijk (Beachclub Zuiderbad) and we love to overstay a weekend in our familyhouse in Zeeland. We enjoying life with our friends and being with our lovely kids.

We have two daughters. One of 16 years and the other is 11 years. We have a dog Rakker, where we enjoy hiking. 

I was born and raised in Amsterdam and also know a lot about this beautiful city to tell.  We like sports, tennis, horse-riding and our daughters play hockey. We love running, swimming and skiing.

One loves all the greenery and around the campsite, the other loves that you are so quickly in the center of Amsterdam. One does not get enough of the knocking of a woodpecker or shouting an owl and the other can't wait to discover the restaurants around us. It actually boils down to the fact that we are lucky to be in the Gardens of West, one of the last undiscovered gems of Amsterdam, from where you are also very quickly in the center.
